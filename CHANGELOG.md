## Unreleased

### Desktop Client

- client: the strings-source gate now forbids a string literal holding any CJK
  character **anywhere** in `ui/*.py`, not only at a whitelisted text setter
  (#65). The old rule could not see a Chinese literal that went through a local
  variable, an f-string, or a setter nobody had listed, and that is exactly the
  path it left open. The check is AST-based, so comments are outside it by
  construction and docstrings are excluded deliberately; the one literal the
  new rule found in the tree — the ideographic comma joining the supported API
  versions in the status view — moved into `strings.py` as `LIST_SEPARATOR`.
  The gate is proven red on a planted literal and green once it is removed, and
  what it still cannot see (text from Qt, text from the service) is stated in
  the test's own docstring. Review follow-ups on the same change: the ranges
  reach above the basic multilingual plane, so an extension-B ideograph is a
  Han character to the gate as well; and both rules enumerate the package
  recursively, so a widget moved into a subpackage is still read. Each of those
  two is held open by a test that fails without it.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-08-19

Presentation, distribution and data release. A third presentation layer — an
owner-private web interface running inside the API process and off by default —
joins the Telegram bot and the HTTP API; the game-data pin moves to Wuthering
Waves 3.6.0 / resource 3.6.4 / changelist 8464573 at upstream commit
`6ce8d5eda49f2930da84d8846c144432142c7465`; the desktop client becomes 0.2.0 and
is published as a release asset for the first time; and every release asset is
now built by a workflow from one reviewed commit rather than by hand. The
project also gains its governance entries, a generic self-hosting guide separate
from the owner's own runbook, and one command that runs every offline gate.

### Game Data

- data: pin Arikatsu 3.6.0 — the active source profile moves to Wuthering
  Waves 3.6.0 / resource 3.6.4 / changelist 8464573 at exact upstream commit
  `6ce8d5eda49f2930da84d8846c144432142c7465` (previously 3.5.0 / 3.5.5 /
  8059200 at `dae29691c04ef0f48d0810b5d244fb0b37288c60`). The candidate built
  from that checkout carries 10951 extracted records, up from 10691, with 260
  added terms, 0 removed and 6 changed zh/en pairs; the offline gates
  (`verify_db.py`, `verify_seed_terms.py`, `verify_exact_hits.py`,
  `verify_idempotent_build.py`) all pass on it and `diff_terms_db.py` reports
  no removed term.
- The required representative exact pair is now `景燃 -> Jingran`, a resonator
  that is new at 3.6 and single-valued in both directions in the built
  database. The 3.5 pair `穗穗 -> Suisui` was retired because 3.6 adds a second
  speaker row `穗穗（通讯中） -> Suisui`, which makes the reverse direction
  ambiguous and would fail the check on a correct build. The verifier's tests
  gained a case for that failure shape (a second zh row carrying the same en).
- No production data is shipped by this change: deployments pick the new pin
  up through `deploy/vps-update.sh`, which refreshes the checkout and rebuilds
  and re-verifies the candidate on the target host.

### HTTP API / Web Presentation Layer

- **New: an owner-private web presentation layer.** A mobile-first browser
  interface for dictionary lookup and sentence translation, mounted inside the
  API process as a sub-application over the same protocol-neutral pipeline the
  Telegram bot and the HTTP API already use. It is **off by default**: with
  `WUWATERM_API_WEB_ENABLED` unset there is no route, no sub-application and no
  entry in the published API document, and the process behaves exactly as it
  did before the layer existed. When enabled it requires a device credential
  held server-side (`WUWATERM_API_WEB_DEVICE_TOKEN`) and a marker the reverse
  proxy injects on every proxied request (`WUWATERM_API_WEB_EDGE_SECRET`);
  without that marker it refuses everything, so reaching the loopback port
  directly does not get past the front door. Session lifetime and the ceiling
  on live sessions are `WUWATERM_API_WEB_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` and
  `WUWATERM_API_WEB_MAX_SESSIONS`. The surface ships no page scripts and the
  browser holds only an opaque HttpOnly session cookie. Decision and cost:
  [ADR 0014](docs/adr/0014-private-web-presentation-layer.md); operation:
  [docs/web-presentation-layer.md](docs/web-presentation-layer.md). The layer
  landed in an earlier pull request without an entry that introduced it; this
  is that entry, written where the surface belongs rather than backdated.
- Malformed serve-only numeric settings no longer block operator credential
  commands such as `device revoke`: `from_env()` now retains their raw forms
  while falling back safely, and `serve` validates all eight values strictly
  before logging, credential-store initialization, app construction or socket
  serving.
- `TERM_QUERY_MAX_LENGTH` is defined once in `wuwaterm_api` and imported by
  both the JSON routes and the web views (previously 200 vs a local 120).
- The web surface envelope now matches the mount path exactly or its
  children only, so a future sibling like `/wuwaterm-webhooks` is not
  rewritten as a web page.
- Restyled the owner-private web surface (markup unchanged): ink-and-gold
  palette with a sharp 3px geometry, underline tabs, gold provenance heading
  on result cards, gold focus rings, and a brand bar across the viewport top.
  All previous functional rules stand: system fonts only, zero scripts, one
  round trip, 16px inputs, `pre-wrap` results.

### Channel Adapter

- Capacity-driven channel skips (`queue_full`, `llm_budget`) now DM the bot
  owner, rate-limited to one notice per 10-minute window with the suppressed
  count folded in. Content gates stay silent by design; only degradation the
  owner could not otherwise see is reported. The notice carries counts and
  internal reason vocabulary only, never post text, and its own delivery
  failure is swallowed into the log.
- Edits now yield to new posts near LLM-budget exhaustion: an edit is
  admitted only if the remaining per-minute budget covers its calls plus a
  two-call headroom (`skipped:edit_yield`). A yielded edit delays refreshing
  an already-delivered translation; a rejected new post would mean no
  translation at all. `ChannelRuntime.budget_remaining` exposes the read-only
  reading the gate uses; admission itself still goes through `reserve`.
- Edit-token bookkeeping is now bounded: tokens share the entry TTL and are
  pruned on `begin_edit` itself, so edits skipped before any remember
  (content gates) no longer accumulate in-process forever.
- Reply-index persistence no longer runs on the event loop. Payloads are
  snapshotted on the loop thread and the write (tmp file + fsync + replace +
  directory fsync) is offloaded, single-flight, coalescing multi-chunk bursts
  into the latest snapshot. Sync callers keep the original inline semantics.
- An edit whose tracked reply still exists but rejects the in-place edit
  ("uneditable", distinct from "gone") now deletes that reply instead of
  leaving it visible but untracked — an orphan that no later edit could ever
  update again. The no-repost-on-gone policy is unchanged.
- Review follow-ups (PR #76): the capacity-notice cooldown and pending count
  are now committed only after the owner DM actually sends; a transient
  failure keeps the count and re-arms after a 60-second retry delay instead
  of silencing alerts for the whole 10-minute window. A successful notice
  clears only the skips it reported, so skips that arrive while the DM is in
  flight survive into the next notice instead of being silently zeroed.
- Edit-token registration is deferred to the moment an edit actually starts
  its first LLM call (the dictionary fast path registers just before its
  emit), so an edit rejected by any bail path — `edit_yield`, `queue_full`,
  `llm_budget`, staleness or authorization rechecks — no longer supersedes an
  admitted in-flight edit whose completed translation was then dropped as
  stale with nothing replacing it.
- The reply index gains `aflush()`, wired to the application's
  `post_shutdown` hook: an offloaded save still queued at shutdown is drained
  (and a cancelled one rewritten inline from memory), and the flush waits out
  an executor write already in flight so an older snapshot cannot replace the
  final one on disk. Replies remembered just before exit survive the restart
  instead of causing duplicate translations. The flush also runs when the
  translator close raises (independent `finally`), and the offloaded writer
  now uses a dedicated single-worker executor whose futures can be awaited
  safely — a job cancelled while still queued raises immediately instead of
  hanging the shutdown flush.
- The edit budget-yield gate is capped by the configured per-minute
  capacity: at `WUWATERM_CHANNEL_LLM_CALLS_PER_MINUTE` of 1-3 the
  required+headroom sum is unreachable even on a fresh window, which would
  have yielded every edit forever; a completely unused window now always
  admits one edit.
- A multi-chunk edit whose later tracked reply rejects edits ("uneditable")
  now deletes that reply instead of dropping it from the rebuilt index while
  leaving it visible — the same orphan the first-chunk path already handles.
  When that delete itself fails, the id stays tracked as a trailing stale
  extra rather than at the chunk position, so the next edit does not map a
  fresh chunk onto the still-uneditable reply.
- The capacity owner notice now reports per-reason counts
  (e.g. `llm_budget ×2、queue_full ×1`) instead of labelling the whole
  aggregated count with whichever reason happened to trigger the notice.
- Web stylesheet: decorative glyphs are literal Unicode again — CSS
  code-point escapes like `\25C6` in a plain Python string parse as octal
  control characters, so the heading diamonds and em-dashes rendered as
  mojibake since the restyle.

### Telegram Bot

- The dictionary stage (exact + full-table fuzzy over sqlite) now runs off
  the event loop via the pipeline's existing `offload` seam, matching what
  the HTTP adapter already did; a fuzzy lookup can no longer stall every
  concurrent handler.

### Desktop Client

- The client is **0.2.0**, the first version distributed as a release asset:
  `WuwaTerm-<version>-windows-x64.zip`, the one-folder build, listed in
  `SHA256SUMS`. It is **not code-signed** — SmartScreen will warn on first run,
  and `client/README.md` says so and shows what to do.
- Compatibility contract: client 0.2.x speaks HTTP API `v1`, served by wuwaterm
  0.3.0 or newer. The client checks it on the `/v1/meta` reply the status view
  already fetches when the owner presses 刷新 — **no new request, and none at
  startup**: an unconfigured client still sends nothing. A server reporting an
  API version this client does not support gets a warning naming both versions,
  while the service facts stay on screen and the client keeps working.

### Distribution And Release Pipeline

- New `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds every release asset from one
  reviewed commit: the wheel and the sdist (with `twine check --strict`, the
  packaging audit and a clean-environment install smoke), the Windows client
  zip (built on a Windows runner through `client/build.ps1` and started with
  `--self-check` before it is packaged), a `SHA256SUMS` covering all three, and
  a `release-manifest.json` recording the tag, both versions, the source
  commit, the build time, the image tags and digests, and the game-data pin.
  It has **no tag trigger**: publishing stays a human step, and a draft
  release still creates no tag, so a discarded draft leaves nothing behind.
- The workflow runs in two modes. `workflow_dispatch` with
  `dry_run=false` is the real one and is the only mode that logs in to the
  container registry, pushes an image, or creates the draft release; every
  other run — including the `pull_request` run that fires when this workflow,
  `deploy/**`, `client/**` or `pyproject.toml` changes — is a dry run that
  builds and checks everything and publishes nothing. Write permissions match:
  the workflow default is read-only, `packages: write` exists only on the
  image job, and `contents: write` only on the job that creates the draft.
- Release-pinned container images: `ghcr.io/my-denia/wuwaterm` (runtime) and
  `ghcr.io/my-denia/wuwaterm-builder` (builder), tagged `vX.Y.Z`, `X.Y` and
  `sha-<7>`, carrying the source, version, revision and created OCI labels.
  Both are published because the runtime image is useless without a terminology
  database, which is built by the builder image and is never distributed. The
  images save the local image build and nothing else: the generic path still
  needs a source checkout at the release tag for the Compose files, the
  entrypoints, the data build and the verification scripts. Whether an
  anonymous pull is permitted is a registry-side setting and is stated as
  something to verify, not as something this project has measured.
- New `.github/workflows/selfhost-smoke.yml` follows the container path of
  `docs/self-hosting.md` on a clean runner — build, `refresh-data`,
  `build-db --atomic`, `verify-db`, promote, start the API alone, issue a
  device credential, one exact lookup, one sentence translation against a mock
  model endpoint started in the job, and a credential-store backup and restore
  — and reports per-step timings. It runs on pull requests that touch
  `deploy/**` or that guide, and can be dispatched at any ref.
- `deploy/docker-compose.yml` reads the builder image reference from
  `WUWATERM_BUILDER_IMAGE`, defaulting to the previous fixed local tag, so a
  self-hoster can point it at a pulled image; `deploy/vps-update.sh` never sets
  it and its behaviour is unchanged. `deploy/docker-compose.ghcr.yml` is a thin
  overlay that sets only the three `image:` fields from `WUWATERM_IMAGE_TAG`.
- `docs/release-checklist.md` is rewritten around the new asset policy and the
  new flow: five assets, images on the registry, the client binary stated as
  unsigned, and a readback performed while the release is still a draft.

### Documentation And Project Governance

- Both READMEs open with an audience router — desktop user, Telegram group
  admin, self-hoster, contributor, owner operations — and now name all four
  surfaces, the owner-private web layer among them. Their two validation
  command blocks route to `python scripts/validate.py` instead of listing
  individual gates, so a contributor runs the same list CI's server matrix
  runs — that one job, on Linux, and no more. A pull request is also checked by
  the uv lock-drift job, the packaging audit, the Windows desktop-client build
  and the Docker runtime/builder boundary job, none of which this entry point
  runs; a green local run is evidence about the server gates, not a prediction
  about the pull request. The candidate-database checks stay listed separately,
  because the entry point deliberately does not run them either.
- New `docs/self-hosting.md`: the generic path for someone who is not the
  author — requirements, a source checkout at a release tag, configuration,
  the data build on both the container and the source path, starting the
  surfaces, issuing the first device credential, a first exact lookup and a
  first sentence translation over HTTP, publishing over HTTPS through any TLS
  terminator, upgrade, backup and restore, rollback, and a troubleshooting
  table. `docs/deployment.md` keeps every word it had and gains a scope banner
  saying it is the author's own production runbook, not the general path.
- New `docs/support-matrix.md`: which Python versions are tested where, why the
  server suite is not supported on a Windows host, what the desktop client
  needs, and the client-to-API compatibility contract.
- New `SECURITY.md` (private reporting through GitHub, what never to paste into
  a report, what is in and out of scope), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (setup, the one
  validation command, what each gate is for, what makes a change easy to
  accept) and `SUPPORT.md` (where to ask, and the boundary of a best-effort
  hobby project); four GitHub issue forms with a redaction acknowledgement,
  their `config.yml`, and a pull-request template. The acknowledgement covers
  host names, addresses and paths that identify a deployment as well as
  credentials and Telegram identifiers, which is what `SECURITY.md` asks a
  reporter to remove and what `SUPPORT.md` says the forms cover.
- `docs/architecture.md` describes the private web layer as the third
  presentation layer inside the API process, including how it reaches the
  pipeline (in process, not over HTTP) and what it deliberately is not; the
  ADR index lists 0013 and 0014; ADR 0014 moves from Proposed to Accepted with
  its basis written out.
- Two corrections of claims that had drifted from the code: `docs/validation.md`
  no longer says the hygiene and non-goal gates catch tokens, API keys or
  Telegram identifiers — it now says what each one actually checks and that no
  gate in this repository scans for secrets — and
  `docs/web-presentation-layer.md` no longer says the edge block has never been
  validated on the target host.
- `deploy/env.example` and `.env.example` document the five
  `WUWATERM_API_WEB_*` keys, commented out, with the note that they belong to
  the API process only. `client/README.md` gains the user path: download the
  release zip, check it against `SHA256SUMS`, unpack it anywhere, and what an
  unsigned build looks like on first run.

### Developer Experience

- `scripts/validate.py` is now the single offline validation entry point:
  hygiene, non-goals, architecture boundaries, the API contract, ruff and the
  test suite, in that order, with `--list` to print what each gate fails on and
  `--quick` to stop before the suite. CI's server matrix runs that one command
  instead of listing the gates itself, so a contributor and a pull request run
  the same list. It is standard library only, and every step runs under the
  interpreter that ran the script, so there is no second Windows form to keep in
  step. Its `--client` step is the exception and says so: no single interpreter
  runs both sides, so that step runs the client's own environment or explains
  how to create it.
- Ruff joins the dev extra, bounded to one minor, with the enabled rule set
  written out (`E4`, `E7`, `E9`, `F`) instead of left to the tool's defaults — a
  wider range would silently change what the gate enforces. The unused imports
  it reported are removed.
- The CI test matrix widens to Python **3.11, 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14** on
  `ubuntu-latest`, so no version inside the declared `requires-python >=3.11`
  floor is untested; `docs/support-matrix.md` records what runs where and what
  the Windows-host reds are.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` proposes GitHub Actions and uv updates monthly, in
  groups rather than one pull request per bump.
- The four hygiene-test defects of issue #75 are fixed and each fix is pinned by
  a test that fails when the handled branch is removed: the Git 2.51+
  `<oid> submodule` response line and the broken-pipe branch gain discriminating
  cases; the missing-response test is rebuilt on a response stream written out
  in the test, because as written it had stopped measuring the marker rule and
  started measuring which git the machine happens to have; and the
  newline-in-path test is skip-guarded on Windows, where its own fixture cannot
  run.

### Upgrading From 0.3.0

- **The terminology database must be rebuilt.** The game-data pin moves from
  3.5.0 to 3.6.0, and no release ships a database. A production host picks the
  pin up through `deploy/vps-update.sh`, which refreshes the checkout, rebuilds
  the candidate, verifies it and promotes it transactionally. A source install
  reruns `refresh-data` and `build-db --atomic` and re-verifies with
  `scripts/verify_db.py` (see [docs/data-refresh.md](docs/data-refresh.md)).
- **Nothing else has to change.** There is no state-directory migration, no
  removed setting, and no change to the Telegram or HTTP surfaces a 0.3.0
  deployment already serves. The owner-private web layer is new and **off by
  default**: with `WUWATERM_API_WEB_ENABLED` unset the process behaves exactly
  as 0.3.0 did.
- **The desktop client is 0.2.0** and is distributed as an unsigned portable zip
  on the release page. A 0.1.x client keeps working against this server; what
  0.2.x adds is the compatibility check, not a new requirement.
- **Release assets moved.** Releases now carry the wheel, the sdist, the client
  zip, `SHA256SUMS` and `release-manifest.json`, all built by
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` from one reviewed commit; container images are
  published to the registry rather than to the release page. Verify that an
  image pull works for you before relying on it; if it is denied, build from
  source ([docs/self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md)).

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-12

API-first release: the Telegram-only bot becomes a multi-adapter system. One
protocol-neutral application layer now serves two presentation adapters — the
existing Telegram bot and a new versioned HTTP API with revocable
device-principal authentication — plus a Windows desktop client that consumes
the API. Game-data pin is unchanged from 0.2.x (Wuthering Waves 3.5.0 /
resource 3.5.5 / changelist 8059200 at
`dae29691c04ef0f48d0810b5d244fb0b37288c60`).

### Maintainer Architecture

- New protocol-neutral application layer (`src/wuwaterm/application.py`) owns
  the dictionary-first translation pipeline exactly once. `bot.py` keeps the
  Telegram wording, HTML parse mode and UTF-16 splitter and delegates the
  pipeline; no intentional Telegram behaviour change.
- Boundary guard gains an `Application` layer that may not import presentation
  modules or the Telegram SDK, even under `TYPE_CHECKING`.

### HTTP Adapter (new)

- New `wuwaterm_api` package: a versioned, plain-text HTTP surface
  (`POST /v1/translations`, `GET /v1/terms`, `GET /v1/meta`, `GET /healthz`,
  `GET /readyz`) served by the same dictionary-first pipeline as the bot.
- Revocable device credentials in their own store (`state-api/devices.db`),
  registered and withdrawn by an operator through the new `wuwaterm-api device`
  commands. The operator supplies the secret on standard input and only a
  salted scrypt verifier is stored: the service never produces or prints
  credential material, so none can reach a log, a terminal recording or a
  captured command output through it.
- Stable error envelope with enumerated codes, request ids, per-device request
  limits, a streaming body-size cap, and a time budget applied to both the body
  read and the handler. Credential verification is itself bounded, so the
  deliberately expensive check cannot become the load.
- Committed contract snapshot `docs/api/openapi.json` with a drift gate
  (`scripts/check_api_contract.py`), which also re-applies the repo's product
  token bans to that JSON artifact.
- The published wheel now ships the `wuwaterm_api` package and a
  `wuwaterm-api` entry point; `scripts/check_package_artifacts.py` requires
  both, so packaging drift stays caught. The `api` extra carries FastAPI and
  uvicorn; the core dependency set is unchanged.
- API budgets are per process and separate from the bot's: its own translator
  instance, its own model concurrency cap (default 2) and its own per-minute
  call budget (default 30).
- The service now writes one structured completion record per request —
  correlation id, method, route, status, duration, and the redacted device
  principal when one authenticated — and `wuwaterm-api serve` installs the
  handler that emits it, on standard error (`WUWATERM_API_LOG_LEVEL`, default
  `INFO`). It had none: every `LOGGER` call in the adapter went nowhere in a
  deployed process, so a request id handed to a client matched nothing on the
  server. The adapter's other diagnostic lines are unchanged and are not part of
  the one-per-request guarantee. The operator subcommands and any program
  importing the application still configure no logging at all.
- Records name the matched route TEMPLATE, or an escaped, bounded target when
  nothing matched, instead of the decoded request path: that value is chosen by
  an unauthenticated caller and is read in a terminal. A target that could be a
  credential is replaced entirely. Nothing the service itself knows — the
  credential it verified, the device id behind the principal, the text it
  translated — appears in any record, which is asserted against captured
  records rather than by inspection.

### Desktop Client (new)

- New `client/` tree: a Windows desktop client for the HTTP adapter, with its
  own `pyproject.toml` outside `src/` so it is never part of the `wuwaterm`
  wheel. `scripts/check_package_artifacts.py` fails if `wuwaterm_client` ever
  appears in a built distribution.
- It calls the published contract and renders what comes back: plain-text
  translation with an automatic or forced direction and mid-flight
  cancellation, dictionary lookup, service status, and the error envelope's
  stable codes plus the transport states only a client can know (offline,
  timed out, cancelled). It contains no translation logic and no Telegram
  concept.
- One device credential, held only in the Windows Credential Manager, never
  written to a config file.
- `client/build.ps1` produces a one-folder PyInstaller build and then runs the
  artifact's own start-up self-check, so a build that cannot start fails the
  build. A `windows-latest` CI job runs the client suite, builds through the
  same script and uploads the artifact.
- A missing, unreadable, malformed or unusable `config.json` now leaves the
  client in an explicit unconfigured state instead of silently substituting a
  local development address: the main window states the configured server
  address (or that none is configured, and where to set one), and every
  request path refuses with the stable code `not_configured` before the
  credential store is read. The settings field opens empty when unconfigured
  and never invents an address (#59).
- Settings saves are atomic (temporary file, fsync, `os.replace`) with
  descriptor-safe failure cleanup, so an interrupted save cannot leave a
  truncated settings file; changing the server address cancels in-flight
  requests and clears answers derived from the previous endpoint (#59).

### Deployment

- New Compose service `wuwaterm-api` runs the same runtime image with
  `command: ["api"]`, mounts the terminology database read-only and keeps its
  own writable `state-api/`, a sibling of the bot's state directory rather than
  a child of it, so the bot's read-write state mount cannot reach the
  credential store. It binds loopback only and publishes no ports, so the
  service opens no listener anything outside the host can reach; a desktop
  client reaches it through a path route on an HTTPS site the host already
  serves, and authenticates every call with its own device credential.
- Documented operator commands read `WUWATERM_API_PORT` from the serving
  container instead of assuming the default, so a deployment that configured
  another port is not read back against a closed one.
- The runtime entry point accepts `bot`, `api` and `device` and still exits 64
  for every data-build command. CI asserts both halves.
- `deploy/vps-update.sh` now stops, restarts, smokes and reads back BOTH
  serving containers. The API smoke runs inside its own container over
  loopback, so nothing has to be exposed to run it.
- Rollback restores what was RUNNING, not what merely existed: both surfaces
  record their running state before the deployment, both go down before the
  database is rolled back, and a stop that fails aborts the restoration
  entirely rather than reverting a database underneath a container that may
  still be serving it.
- The device store refuses to start an empty store at the new
  `state-api/devices.db` while an older `state/api/devices.db` still holds the
  verifiers; that would have looked like a clean start while every registered
  device stopped authenticating.
- `scripts/check_non_goals.py` skips nested virtual environments and build
  output at any depth, so a per-component venv cannot drown the product gate in
  third-party matches.
- The API's default port is now **8788**. The previous default was already
  bound on the deployment target by an unrelated service and was the upstream
  of that host's existing routes, so the old default would have taken over a
  running service rather than adding one. The port remains a setting; nothing
  in the contract or the client depends on the number. An existing `.env` that
  sets `WUWATERM_API_PORT` explicitly still wins over both defaults, so the
  deployment guide now says to update that line and read the port back from the
  recreated container: a changed default does not reach a host that pinned the
  old one.

### Documentation

- `docs/architecture.md` rewritten for the system that now exists: two
  presentation adapters over one application layer plus a client that consumes
  the API, the component map including the adapter's import allowlist, the
  trust boundaries including the public HTTPS edge, the two separate identity
  models and the explicit statement that neither can grant the other, and a
  cost-topology section stating that the per-process budgets are never global
  and that the worst case is their sum.
- Four new decision records: [0009](docs/adr/0009-http-api-adapter.md) the HTTP
  adapter (amending the context of 0001 and 0003, whose long-polling decision
  is unchanged), [0010](docs/adr/0010-device-principal-authentication.md)
  device-principal authentication,
  [0011](docs/adr/0011-pc-client-stack.md) the PC client stack and its
  transport policy, and
  [0012](docs/adr/0012-client-transport-selection.md) the transport selection
  itself, with its trust boundary, threat model, credential lifecycle,
  endpoint configuration, verification, deployment and rollback, and the
  documented future migration path.
- `docs/deployment.md` gains the route that publishes the API, its backup,
  reload and one-block rollback, and the readback that has to happen on the
  client machine to mean anything. `docs/validation.md` gains the contract,
  client-transport and client-build gates and where each runs.

### Upgrading From 0.2.1

- Deploy only through `deploy/vps-update.sh` on a clean Git checkout where
  `HEAD == origin/main` (see `docs/deployment.md`). The updater now manages
  BOTH serving containers; rollback covers both.
- The HTTP API is a second, loopback-only container. Its credential store
  lives in a new `state-api/` directory, a sibling of the bot's `state/`.
  Devices are registered by an operator over SSH with
  `wuwaterm-api device issue` (secret supplied on standard input) and revoked
  with `wuwaterm-api device revoke`. Nothing is exposed publicly by default;
  publication happens through a reverse-proxy path route the host already
  serves (see `docs/deployment.md` and ADR 0012).
- The API's default port is 8788; a `.env` that pins `WUWATERM_API_PORT`
  wins over the default.
- The desktop client is built from source with `client/build.ps1` (or taken
  from the CI artifact); it stores its device credential only in the OS
  credential manager and starts unconfigured until a server address is set
  in Settings.
- No bot state-directory migration and no game-data pin change from 0.2.1.
  Telegram behaviour is unchanged apart from the shared application layer
  refactor, which is covered by the existing test suite.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-08-06

Maintenance release packaging post-v0.2.0 production hardening already merged
as PRs #41–#45. Game-data pin stays Wuthering Waves 3.5.0 / resource 3.5.5 /
changelist 8059200 at `dae29691c04ef0f48d0810b5d244fb0b37288c60`.

### Telegram Runtime (#41–#43)

- Channel LLM content-shape failures (`invalid_response` / `html_integrity`)
  now retry once as plain text instead of dropping the post, within the
  per-minute call budget (including correct behaviour when the budget is 1).
- Malformed API envelopes are reported as `invalid_api_response`, separate
  from content-shape `invalid_response`.
- Inline `/tr <text>` preserves Telegram rich-text entities; PTB error
  handling covers NetworkError-style update failures.
- Normalization fixes: spoiler markers and version tags no longer eat
  mid-sentence prose or mangle URLs; term-lock / fuzzy design flaws that
  produced wrong translations are repaired with regression tests.
- Delivery and observability hardening for linked-channel paths.

### Maintainer Architecture (#44–#45)

- Formal architecture map (`docs/architecture.md`) and ADRs 0001–0008.
- Fail-closed import-boundary guard (`scripts/check_architecture_boundaries.py`)
  wired into local validation and CI, with Codex P2 follow-ups for nested
  packages and TYPE_CHECKING / presentation import rules.
- No intentional runtime behaviour change in #44–#45.

### Upgrading From 0.2.0

- Deploy only through `deploy/vps-update.sh` on a clean Git checkout where
  `HEAD == origin/main` (see `docs/deployment.md`). Runtime fixes from
  #41–#43 may already be live on long-running hosts; this release still
  advances package version metadata and ships the architecture guard.
- No state-directory migration and no game-data pin change from 0.2.0.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-17

Production hardening release: Wuthering Waves 3.5 data pin, transactional VPS
deployment, Telegram structural safety, and default CI packaging gates.

### Upgrading From 0.1.0

- The deployment target must be a clean Git checkout with an `origin` remote
  and a `main` ref; exported non-Git source copies are intentionally not
  deployable. Live upgrades go through `deploy/vps-update.sh`; see
  `docs/deployment.md`.
- Runtime state (`chat_settings.json`, `channel_replies.json`) moved from
  `data/` to `state/`. The updater and runtime perform a validated one-time
  migration and never overwrite existing state files.
- The runtime image only runs the bot; data refresh/build/verify commands
  moved to the builder image. Rebuild the terms database with the 3.5 pin via
  the transactional updater (`docs/data-refresh.md`).

### CI And Packaging

- Added `scripts/check_package_artifacts.py`, a wheel/sdist content audit that
  fails on generated databases, game data, runtime state, environment files,
  deployment internals, secret-looking files, missing package members, and
  version-metadata drift against `pyproject.toml`.
- Extended default CI with lockfile drift checking (`uv lock --check` pinned to
  the deploy image's uv version), wheel/sdist build with strict metadata
  validation and clean-venv install/import/CLI smoke for both artifacts,
  deploy shell script syntax checks, compose config validation, and Docker
  runtime/builder boundary assertions (runtime refuses non-bot commands and
  ships without git/uv).

### Data And Deployment

- Updated the active source profile to Wuthering Waves 3.5.0 / resource 3.5.5
  / changelist 8059200 at exact upstream commit
  `dae29691c04ef0f48d0810b5d244fb0b37288c60`, with observed checkout and
  README provenance recorded in generated DB metadata.
- Added read-only strong candidate verification, including schema, integrity,
  metadata, category, and `穗穗 -> Suisui` exact-hit gates.
- Made VPS updates transactional around a separately verified candidate and
  immutable revision-labelled image, with DB/image/pointer rollback and an
  immutable deployment manifest. Builder containers no longer receive the
  runtime `.env`.

### Telegram Runtime

- Protected every Telegram HTML tag, attribute, link, custom emoji id, and
  entity with opaque structural placeholders so only visible text reaches the
  translator; structural drift now fails closed.
- Added bounded linked-channel admission, atomic multi-chunk LLM call budgets,
  post-queue freshness/authorization checks, privacy-safe outcome telemetry,
  and owner status counters.
- Hardened linked-channel reply-index schema validation and persistence
  diagnostics, including explicit reporting when directory durability is
  uncertain.
- Avoided fuzzy dictionary scans for long translation inputs while retaining
  exact and short ASCII/pinyin lookup behavior.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-04

Initial release preparation for the self-hosted WuWa Term Bot.

### Added

- Dictionary-first Chinese to official English and English to Chinese term
  lookup from a locally built SQLite database.
- Term-locked sentence translation through an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, with
  exact database hits returned before any LLM call.
- Telegram bot commands for private and group use, including group allowlists,
  public-mode controls, linked-channel auto-translation, rate limits, and
  privacy-safe operational logging.
- Local validation and hygiene scripts that guard against committing generated
  game data, generated databases, and unsupported runtime surfaces.

### Data Source

- Supported source profile: `arikatsu`
- Supported game data version: `GameVer 3.4.0 | ResVer 3.4.13`
- Pinned source repository: `https://github.com/Arikatsu/WutheringWaves_Data`
- Pinned source commit: `58ec43698d2b4e188cb285467ce1ae887612dd92`

### Known Limitations

- The bot is self-hosted; no public hosted service is provided by this
  repository.
- Live Telegram behavior still requires owner-provided bot credentials and
  chat configuration.
- Free-text sentence translation requires a separately configured
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- Generated TextMap data and generated term databases are local artifacts and
  are not published in this source repository.
