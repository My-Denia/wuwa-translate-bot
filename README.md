## Why WuwaTerm

WuwaTerm is for anyone who reads or writes about Wuthering Waves across Chinese and English: fan translators, guide and wiki writers, and community admins.

A general-purpose translator sees game names as ordinary words, so an official name can come back paraphrased, or rendered differently from one sentence to the next. WuwaTerm checks a dictionary built from the game's own text data first. When the whole query is a term, you get the dictionary's official string back byte for byte, with no model involved. When it is a sentence, the matching terms are locked before any text reaches a language model and put back unchanged afterwards.

  <br>
  <sub>The public beta, captured 2026-09-13. Its interface is in Chinese, and you can type in either language. 声骸 is listed twice because the game uses the term in two categories.</sub>
</p>

## What you can do

- **Look up a term in either direction.** Type Chinese or English and get the official pair. Short romanised queries such as `shenghai` can also match by pinyin.
- **Translate a sentence with the names locked.** The direction is detected from the script, or you choose it. If a locked term goes missing or comes back altered, you get an error instead of a wrong name.
- **Review a translation you already have.** Paste the source and your translation; WuwaTerm shows which official terms are confirmed and which need a look, and offers the official pair for each. It checks terminology only, not sentence meaning, and never calls a model.
- **Pick up where you left off.** The review workbench saves your draft as a manuscript file on your own computer, and you import it later to continue. There are no accounts and no cloud copy of your manuscript.

  <br>
  <sub>Review on the public beta: “Jinhsi” is confirmed; no official rendering of 声骸 is found in the translation, so the workbench offers “Echo”. Where it had to shorten a candidate list, the report says so instead of claiming a complete check. The image is cropped.</sub>
</p>

### Where it runs

| Surface | What it does | What you need |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public web beta | Lookup, translation, review, manuscript files | A browser |
| Telegram bot | Lookup, translation, auto-translating a linked channel | Your own server and bot token |
| Windows client | Lookup, translation | A server address and device token |
| HTTP API | Lookup, translation, review | Your own server |

<sub>Outside the public beta, sentence translation also needs an OpenAI-compatible model configured on the server.</sub>

## How it works

<img src="docs/assets/readme/how-it-works-en.png" alt="How WuwaTerm works: dictionary hits return official strings without a model; free text is term-locked before an OpenAI-compatible model translates it; the dictionary is built locally from pinned public game-text data">

Telegram commands and the HTTP API share one dictionary-first application layer, and the public beta and the Windows client reach it through the API. Linked-channel auto-translation has its own orchestration over the same dictionary lookup and term locking. The terminology database is a local SQLite file you build from a pinned public copy of the game's text data; it is never shipped in a release or container image. The model is optional: without one, dictionary lookups still work. Modules, trust boundaries and request flows are mapped in [Architecture](docs/architecture.md).

## Get started

### Try it now

Open the [public beta](https://wuwaterm.denia-official.chatgpt.site). There is no sign-up. The interface is in Chinese, but you can type English, and lookups show both languages. Everyone shares the same first-come daily limits, counted separately for lookups, translations and reviews and reset at 00:00 UTC, so it can be busy or run out, and there is no SLA. Please do not paste personal or sensitive text. Limits are in [Public Beta Site](docs/sites.md) and privacy details in [Privacy and LLM](docs/privacy-and-llm.md#anonymous-public-beta-site).

### Run your own

The [self-hosting guide](docs/self-hosting.md) goes from a checkout at a release tag to a first lookup: Docker Compose on Linux (or Python 3.11+ from source), about 2 GB of disk for the upstream data, and your own Telegram bot token and OpenAI-compatible endpoint if you want those features.

### Windows client

Download `WuwaTerm-<client version>-windows-x64.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/My-Denia/wuwa-translate-bot/releases/latest), not the “Source code” archive. It is a portable, unsigned build, so Windows SmartScreen asks you to choose “More info” and then “Run anyway”. The client talks to a WuwaTerm server through its API and needs a device token from whoever runs that server; it does not connect to the public beta. See the [client guide](client/README.md) (in Chinese).

### Telegram bot

There is no shared public bot. Run the bot on your own server with your own BotFather token, then authorize the groups it may serve.

| You send | The bot replies with |
| --- | --- |
| `/tr 声骸` | `Echo` |
| `/tr Echo` | `声骸` |
| `/tr --to en 今汐装备了声骸` | the sentence in English, names locked |

Commands, group authorization and linked-channel auto-translation are covered in [Telegram Behavior](docs/telegram-behavior.md).

### HTTP API

Versioned `/v1` routes cover terms, translations and reviews, each authenticated with a revocable device token. The committed contract is [`docs/api/openapi.json`](docs/api/openapi.json), and the self-hosting guide walks through a [first lookup and translation](docs/self-hosting.md#first-lookup-first-translation).

## Under the hood

- **Python 3.11+** with python-telegram-bot (long polling) and FastAPI, over a SQLite dictionary that the serving containers mount read-only.
- **Architecture rules that CI enforces**: the application layer imports no presentation code, and the API contract is drift-checked against a committed OpenAPI snapshot ([ADR 0009](docs/adr/0009-http-api-adapter.md)).
- **Revocable device credentials** for the API, stored only as salted scrypt verifiers ([ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-device-principal-authentication.md)).
- **Transactional updates** in the maintainer's deployment tooling: the new image, and for data updates a candidate database, is verified before the running service is touched, and an ordinary failure restores the previous image, database and commit pointer ([ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-candidate-verification-and-transactional-deployment.md)).
- **A Windows client** in PySide6 that holds no translation logic ([ADR 0011](docs/adr/0011-pc-client-stack.md)), and **a public beta** built as a Cloudflare Worker that proxies the same API.

## Project status

WuwaTerm is a personal hobby project, maintained on a best-effort basis. The latest tagged release is on the [Releases page](https://github.com/My-Denia/wuwa-translate-bot/releases); `main` moves ahead of it, and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) marks what is unreleased. The public beta promises no fixed availability or response time. Where to ask questions and what to expect is in [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md).

## Contributing

- **Getting a wrong result?** Open a [bug report](https://github.com/My-Denia/wuwa-translate-bot/issues/new/choose) with your query, what WuwaTerm returned and what the game shows. A term that is wrong in the game data itself has to be fixed upstream ([SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md)).
- **Want to change code or docs?** Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Local validation has one entry point: `python scripts/validate.py`.
- **Found a security problem?** Report it privately as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
