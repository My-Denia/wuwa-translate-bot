"""PyInstaller spec for the WuwaTerm desktop client.

One-folder build: client/build.ps1 drives
``pyinstaller client/WuwaTerm.spec`` and produces
``client/dist/WuwaTerm/WuwaTerm.exe``. No code signing.

The names below (Analysis, PYZ, EXE, COLLECT, SPECPATH) are injected into
this file's execution namespace by PyInstaller itself when it runs the spec;
they are not imports.

# PyInstaller resolves an extension module's dependent DLLs through the build
# machine's PATH. `_ssl.pyd` is taken from this interpreter, but its
# `libssl-3-x64.dll` / `libcrypto-3-x64.dll` are whatever PATH found first, so
# a machine with any other OpenSSL installed silently ships a mismatched pair
# and the built program dies at start-up with
# "ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _ssl" the first time anything
# constructs an HTTP client. Bind this interpreter's own copies explicitly.
#
# Where those files live differs between interpreters - a uv-managed CPython
# keeps them in DLLs/, other builds keep them beside python.exe, and the file
# name carries a different suffix per platform - so several locations are
# searched with a loose pattern. An interpreter with no OpenSSL beside it at
# all is not an error: it may be linked statically. The artifact's own
# --self-check is what actually proves the built program can open a
# connection, and it runs on every build.
