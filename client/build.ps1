.SYNOPSIS
    Version-bounded, self-checked one-folder PyInstaller build for the
    WuwaTerm desktop client.

.DESCRIPTION
    Builds client/dist/WuwaTerm/WuwaTerm.exe from client/WuwaTerm.spec using
    the client's own virtual environment (client/.venv). Fails loudly if the
    venv, PySide6, or pyinstaller are missing, rather than falling back to a
    system Python or a different GUI toolkit. No code signing is performed.

    What "version-bounded, self-checked" claims, precisely: the spec is
    committed, the dependency ranges in client/pyproject.toml bound what may
    be installed, this exact script is what CI runs on windows-latest, and the
    artifact it produces is started with --self-check before the build is
    called a success.

    What it does NOT claim: bit-for-bit reproducibility, nor even identical
    inputs between two runs. The client has no lock file - its dependencies
    are ranges (PySide6>=6.7,<7 and pyinstaller>=6.10,<7 among them) - and the
    interpreter patch release and the CI runner image both float, so a later
    build can legitimately consume different versions. There is no
    build-timestamp normalisation, no hash-seed pinning and no two-build
    comparison here either, so two runs are not expected to produce identical
    bytes and nothing verifies that they do. Any such guarantee would have to
    be built and checked; do not read one into this script.
