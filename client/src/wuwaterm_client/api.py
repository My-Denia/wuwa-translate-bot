# the `/v1/*` paths every method below calls, and the `api_version` field of
# `GET /v1/meta` - as served by wuwaterm >= 0.3.0. The constant lives in this
# module because this module is the one that owns the protocol: it builds the
# paths and it parses the replies, so a version the client no longer speaks
# would be a change HERE, not in a view.
#
# It is checked on the `/v1/meta` reply the status view ALREADY fetches when
# the owner presses 刷新. Nothing about this check sends a request - not at
# startup, not on a timer, not anywhere else. The unconfigured client still
# sends nothing at all, which is a tested invariant of this application
# (issues #68 / #80) and not something a compatibility check may spend.

    `AsyncHTTPTransport(verify=False)` would otherwise slip past a guarantee
    that says no argument can weaken verification.

    Only two kinds are accepted, by EXACT type:

    * `httpx.MockTransport`, whose handler is a callable supplied by the same
      test that constructs it; and
    * `httpx.AsyncHTTPTransport`, whose SSL context this function can read -

    proves nothing about what its `handle_async_request` does: a subclass, or
    any other implementation, can expose a verifying context while sending
    the request down a connection that verifies nothing. Reading a decoy is
    worse than reading nothing, so an implementation this function cannot
    reason about is refused rather than inspected.

    What this does NOT claim: a `MockTransport` handler is arbitrary in-process
    code and could itself hand the request to something unverified. That is not
    a hole this function can close, and it is not one worth pretending to -
    in-process code can already replace anything here. It is bounded instead by

    client's interface, is passed by nothing the application ships (grep it),
