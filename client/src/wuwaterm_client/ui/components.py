"""The shared widgets every view in this client is assembled from.

Two rules shape this module.

The first is that no display text is written here. tests/test_ui_strings_source
statically rejects a literal handed to a text-setting call anywhere under ui/,
so a component either receives its text from the caller or reads it from
``strings``. What a component owns is SHAPE and STATE, never wording.

The second is that a Qt widget does not restyle itself when a dynamic
property changes. ``setProperty`` alone leaves the old style applied; the
style has to be told to recompute with ``unpolish``/``polish``. Doing that at
every call site is how half of them end up missing it and the badge stays the
wrong color, so every property switch in this codebase goes through
``set_dynamic_property`` below and lives inside a component method. Call sites
never touch a dynamic property directly.
