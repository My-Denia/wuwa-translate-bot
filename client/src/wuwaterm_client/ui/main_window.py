"""The window the three areas live in, and the two flows that decide what the
client is allowed to do at all.

Four things here are structural rather than cosmetic.

The areas are switched by a navigation column, not by tabs. Tabs put the three
areas on one line and gave nothing a permanent home; the column has a foot,
and the foot is where the address this client talks to is stated - once, in
one widget, visible from every area.

That statement is the reason this file exists in the shape it does. The client
used to substitute a machine-local development address whenever its settings
file could not be read, and nothing on screen said which address was in use,
so a missing ``config.json`` looked exactly like an unreachable service. The
chip, the global banner and the setup checklist are three non-overlapping
sentences about that one state: what it is, what it costs, and where to fix
it. None of the three asks the network anything.

Nothing that refuses is a modal any more, with two exceptions the owner
confirmed: the destructive "forget this credential" question, and About. A
refusal that steals focus and then disappears leaves no trace of what was
refused; a refusal on a banner or against the field that caused it stays
readable while the owner fixes it.

And a refusal must not half-apply. The address goes to the live transport
first because it is the only part that can be refused, and every line that
follows - timeouts, the discard of the previous endpoint's state, the chip,
the file on disk - is downstream of that one check.
