"""The dispatch tables cover the error taxonomy exactly.

An error code with no place to appear is an error the owner never sees. That
used to be a review question - somebody had to notice, while reading a view,
that one branch of a match had been left out. These tests turn it into a
failing suite: the three tables in ui/error_presentation.py must have exactly
the key set of errors.MESSAGE_BY_CODE, no code missing and none invented, and
every value must come from the small vocabularies the views know how to draw.

Set EQUALITY rather than containment is deliberate. Containment would pass a
table that had grown a key for a code that no longer exists, and that stale
row is how a renamed code ends up dispatched under two names at once.

This module imports no Qt: error_presentation holds classifications only, so
the check runs without a display or an event loop.
