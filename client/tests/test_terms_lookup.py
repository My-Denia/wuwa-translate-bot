"""What the lookup area adds on top of the behaviours it inherited.

The inherited ones - submit-driven requests, the in-flight guard, a cleared
table on failure and on an address change - live in
``test_view_parity_with_main.py``, which states them as a list derived from
the previous implementation. This file holds only what the redesign
introduced and is answerable for on its own:

* refusing to send when there is no address, and saying so in the area rather
  than repeating the window's setup checklist;
* refusing to send a SENTENCE, and handing it to the area that can translate
  it instead of answering with an empty dictionary table;
* the request-id row's three states - shown for any completed request, absent
  when no request has happened at all.

None of the three needs a timer, which is why they survived the withdrawal of
search-as-you-type: each is decided at the moment the owner submits.
