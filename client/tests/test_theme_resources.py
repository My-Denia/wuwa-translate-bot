"""The theme is a chain, and every link fails quietly.

A stylesheet that is not packaged, a token defined in one scheme but not the
other, a placeholder nobody substituted - none of them stop the application.
It starts, it works, and it looks like an unstyled prototype; the artifact's
own `--self-check` constructs the window and never looks at it. That is
precisely the shape of defect a test suite has to carry, because no runtime
check will.

No Qt is constructed here. `load_stylesheet` reads a file and substitutes
text, and the degradation path has to work in a process that has no
application object at all.
