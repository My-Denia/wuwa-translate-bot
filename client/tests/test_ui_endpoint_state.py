"""The window has to show which server it is talking to, or that it has none.

The failure this closes was invisible by construction: the client silently
adopted a machine-local development address whenever its settings file could
not be read, and nothing on screen said which address was in use - so a
missing `config.json` looked exactly like an unreachable service.

The claim is now made by three widgets instead of one label, and each of them
is checked here: the chip in the navigation column (a word and a shortened
address, plus the full sentence for assistive technology), the global banner
that states nothing will be sent, and the setup checklist that says what is
missing. They are refreshed together on purpose - a window that says "not
configured" in one corner and shows an address in another is worse than one
that says nothing - so they are asserted together too.

Real Qt under the offscreen platform (conftest.py), like the other UI tests
here; the state logic itself is a plain function so it can be checked without
driving a widget.

The name is `test_ui_*` to match the other Qt files, and that is now the only
reason for it. It began as a workaround: `tests/test_packaging_entry.py` built
its own QApplication in-process, libshiboken refuses a second one while a
session-scoped instance is alive, and this file - first called
`test_main_window_endpoint_state.py` - sorted earlier and broke it on sight.
That constraint is history: the packaging probe runs in a child interpreter
now, and `test_the_suite_does_not_depend_on_this_file_running_first` keeps it
that way. A new Qt test file here can be called anything.
