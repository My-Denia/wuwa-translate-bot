# WuwaTerm anonymous public beta Site

The current public entry is
<https://wuwaterm.denia-official.chatgpt.site>. It is anonymously reachable,
requires no WuwaTerm account, and offers Chinese-English official-term lookup
plus bidirectional, term-locked sentence translation through one shared public
beta pool. It is a best-effort hobby service: one visitor can exhaust the pool,
requests can be busy or fail, and there is no SLA.

## Evidence boundaries

- **Repository fact:** `site/` is a separately built Hosted / Cloudflare Worker
  BFF. The browser calls only same-origin `/api/pool`, `/api/terms` and
  `/api/translations`; the server-side proxy holds the device credential and
  calls the published `/v1` contract. There is no visitor account system in
  this application code.
- **Hosted platform control:** the hosting platform owns deployment versions,
  resources and any platform-level access control. Those values are not encoded
  by the application tree. Anonymous reachability does not prove a particular
  ACL value or immutable deployed-version identity.
- **VPS fact:** the supported production topology keeps dictionary lookup,
  ranking, direction detection, term locking and model calls on the authoritative
  VPS API. The Site contains no second translation pipeline. A documentation
  check or public response is not a fresh attestation of a particular VPS
  process, container or commit.
- **Current production observation (2026-09-06):** cookie-free requests reached
  the public pages and same-origin API; exact lookup and one tested sentence in
  each direction succeeded, while another admitted translation first returned a
  busy response and later succeeded after the suggested wait. This establishes
  the tested behavior, not universal model accuracy or future availability.

Optional `/api/meta` exposes only term count, data schema version and the existing
request correlation ID. The Telegram bot, Windows client and API contract are
separate surfaces and are unchanged by public Site access.

## Shared pool contract

There is no per-visitor, per-IP or personal fair-use allowance. A single caller
can exhaust the entire pool. D1 stores one singleton row of aggregate counters:
second/minute/day window numbers and admitted request/input counts. It never
stores or derives visitor identifiers, IPs, hashes, input, output, request IDs,
accounts or history. No cleanup scheduler is required: the row is overwritten
as active windows advance; inactive old aggregate windows can remain until
another admission. This is not a time-based deletion promise.

| Boundary | Public beta ceiling |
| --- | --- |
| All upstream routes combined | 6 admissions / fixed UTC minute; 1 / UTC second |
| Translation | 1 admission / fixed UTC minute |
| Terms | 240 admissions / UTC day |
| Translation | 30 admissions and 12,000 raw Unicode characters / UTC day |
| Optional meta | 60 admissions / UTC day |
| Inputs | query <=200 trimmed Unicode characters; translation <=2,000 raw characters; streamed body <=32,768 bytes |

Terms and translations have independent daily counters. Disabling translation,
exhausting its count or character pool, or VPS model unavailability does not
disable terms. Terms can still be busy under the total short window, its own
daily cap or infrastructure failure.

One atomic conditional SQLite UPSERT checks and increments all applicable
counters. No read-then-write race or partial multi-counter reservation.
Database clock determines the windows. Admission precedes exactly one BFF
fetch. There is no automatic retry or refund on error, cancellation, ambiguous
DB response or upstream timeout. Missing/invalid settings, missing D1, failed
queries and acquisition exceeding 1s fail closed, with no upstream call.
Rejected requests do not count as admitted requests.

Public beta ceilings reserve headroom against the upstream
device contract, including adjacent fixed-window bursts and dispatch delay.
The extra second gate reduces bursts. Network delay and other users of the
same credential can still produce upstream 429; upstream admission remains
authoritative. The values shown by the live Site are a changing snapshot, not
demonstrated sustainable throughput or an availability promise.

The pool limits admitted upstream work and translation input. It does not
guarantee a currency bill, fairness, availability, DDoS resistance, bounded
inbound Worker/D1 requests, or a shared budget across the API and Telegram
processes. A <=2,000-character client request uses the existing single model
attempt path, when dictionary-first processing requires it.

## Runtime configuration

Existing secret values stay server-only in the Sites environment. Never put
them in hosting metadata, browser code, source control, evidence or URLs.

| Variable | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `WUWATERM_API_BASE_URL` | Existing pinned HTTPS mount; unchanged |
| `WUWATERM_API_ALLOWED_HOST` | Existing exact lower-case hostname; unchanged |
| `WUWATERM_SITE_DEVICE_TOKEN` | Existing dedicated device; unchanged |
| `WUWATERM_SHARED_POOL_ENABLED` | Must explicitly equal `true`; otherwise all upstream requests fail closed |
| `WUWATERM_TRANSLATION_ENABLED` | `true` enables the current public translation surface; `false` pauses translations while preserving the independent lookup pool |
| `WUWATERM_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | Exact approved HTTPS Sites origin with no trailing slash, credentials, path, port or query; enables canonical/OG/robots/sitemap metadata |

`.openai/hosting.json` declares logical `DB` only; no real database ID or
secret. `db/schema.ts`, `drizzle.config.ts` and generated `drizzle/` migrations
own schema changes. Runtime never creates/alters tables. Sites owns production
resources and applies migrations. A failed deployment can leave migrations
applied: inspect the applied boundary before retrying and never edit applied
migration history.

The current public origin publishes canonical, robots and sitemap metadata. The
origin never derives from request or forwarded hosts. All API responses remain
no-store/noindex and public UI errors use fixed copy.

## Validation and operations

From `site/`:

~~~sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run verify:no-client-secret
~~~

Tests include proxy failure/secret contracts, real SQLite boundary fixtures and
a genuine local Cloudflare D1/Worker concurrency test using a synthetic upstream.
They do not prove a current Hosted deployment, physical VPS binding, model
reliability or public uptime. Browser acceptance and live probes are separate
evidence and must be labelled with their observation time.

Any later change to the public slug, platform access control, D1/environment,
saved version, credentials, translation switch or deployment remains a separate
owner-authorized action. Read the exact current object before changing it and
retain rollback/readback evidence. Turning off translation preserves the
independent lookup pool; never clear live counters as a recovery shortcut.

Historical owner-only, M0, runner-blocked and private-acceptance records remain
historical evidence. The current public beta does not rewrite them into success
or prove steps that those runs left unresolved. See the original
[shared-only design](superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-wuwaterm-shared-beta.md).
