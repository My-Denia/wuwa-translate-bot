# The owner-private web presentation layer

A mobile-first browser interface for dictionary lookup and sentence
translation, for the owner's own use from a phone. It is a third presentation
layer over the same protocol-neutral pipeline the Telegram bot and the HTTP API
already use, and it runs **inside the API process** rather than as a service of
its own. The reasoning for that, and the cost it carries, are recorded in
[ADR 0014](adr/0014-private-web-presentation-layer.md).

This document extends [deployment.md](deployment.md); the route below is a
second block in the same site that already carries the API route, and every
precondition listed there applies here unchanged.

## It is off unless you turn it on

The layer is not mounted unless `WUWATERM_API_WEB_ENABLED` says so. With the
switch off there is no route, no sub-application, and no entry in the published
API document — the process behaves exactly as it did before this layer existed.
Turning it off again is a restart, and it is the first thing to do if the layer
is ever suspected in an API problem.

## Settings

| variable | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WUWATERM_API_WEB_ENABLED` | `false` | Mount the layer at all. Accepts `1/0`, `true/false`, `yes/no`, `on/off`; anything else fails the process rather than being read as "off". |
| `WUWATERM_API_WEB_DEVICE_TOKEN` | — | The device token the browser session is mapped onto. Required when enabled. **Server-side only** — it is never sent to the browser and must never be typed into one. |
| `WUWATERM_API_WEB_EDGE_SECRET` | — | Shared marker the reverse proxy injects on every proxied request. Required when enabled: with it unset the layer refuses everything. |
| `WUWATERM_API_WEB_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` | `43200` | Browser session lifetime. |
| `WUWATERM_API_WEB_MAX_SESSIONS` | `32` | Ceiling on live sessions. |

Issue the device token the normal way (`wuwaterm-api device issue`), give it
both scopes, and put it in the environment file the API container reads. It is
an ordinary device from the credential store's point of view — it can be listed
and revoked like any other, and revoking it ends the browser session on the
next request.

**Note where those values land.** The Compose deployment gives the bot and the
API the *same* `../.env`, so writing the web variables there expands them into
the bot's process as well — a service with no web surface holding the web
device token and the edge marker. The Compose file therefore blanks all three
in the bot service's `environment:` block, which overrides `env_file`. If you
deploy some other way, reproduce that: either give the API its own environment
file, or blank these three for every process that is not the API.

## The route

Two things are added to the **existing** site block — the same one that already
carries the API route. The prefix is not stripped: the mount path inside the
process and the public path are deliberately identical, so the application
never has to reconstruct where it lives.

```caddyfile
handle /wuwaterm-web/* {
    basic_auth {
        # `caddy hash-password` output. Not a plain password.
        owner <bcrypt-hash>
    }
    # The port from the deployment readback, not the default assumed here.
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8788 {
        # header_up is a reverse_proxy SUBDIRECTIVE. Written at handle level it
        # is not a valid directive and `caddy validate` rejects the file.
        header_up X-Wuwaterm-Edge "<the value of WUWATERM_API_WEB_EDGE_SECRET>"
    }
}
```

`caddy validate` was run against this block on the target host during the
2026-08-16 deployment, and the read-only readback of 2026-08-19 found the route
live and the proxy serving it. That is a statement about one host on two dates,
not a property of the block: applying it anywhere else, or after editing it
here, still means validating before reloading — which is what the commands
below do.

`basic_auth` is the private protection layer: an unauthenticated request is
refused by the proxy and never reaches the application at all. The injected
header is the second half — the application refuses any request that arrives
without it, so reaching the loopback port directly does not get past the front
door either. Neither half is sufficient alone and both are cheap.

Apply it the same way as any other change to this file:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/caddy/Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile.bak.$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
sudo caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

**Rollback is deleting that block and reloading**, exactly as for the API
route. The service keeps running, still bound to loopback; removing the route
removes the exposure, because there is no second place the surface could be
reached from.

## From the phone

Open `https://<the-existing-site>/wuwaterm-web/`. The browser asks for the
basic-auth credentials once and the browser's own password manager can keep
them. Two tabs: **查词** for dictionary lookup, **翻译** for sentence
translation. The interface is in Chinese.

Nothing needs to be installed, and there is no sign-in inside the page: the
device token stays on the server, and what the browser receives is an opaque
session cookie marked HttpOnly, so page scripts cannot read it — and this page
ships no scripts at all.

## Checking it after a change

- `https://<site>/wuwaterm-web/` renders the lookup form.
- A known term returns its official English string.
- With the switch off, the same address returns `404`.
- Requesting it without the basic-auth credentials returns `401` from the proxy
  and produces no application log line.
- The API's own routes answer exactly as before, and `/openapi.json` lists the
  same paths it listed before the layer existed.

## What this layer deliberately does not do

No public registration, and no change to how the service is distributed. It
adds no second translation path: the same dictionary-first pipeline answers
here, through the same objects rather than a second set of its own.

Be precise about what that shares, because the two halves differ and an
earlier version of this page ran them together:

- **Model spending is one account.** There is a single per-minute budget for
  the whole process, so the browser cannot open a second tab on the bill. If
  the desktop client has exhausted it, the browser is refused too.
- **Admission rate is per device.** The limiter buckets by device id, so the
  web credential issued above carries its own per-minute allowance alongside
  the desktop client's. Two of the owner's devices genuinely get two
  allowances; that is what a per-device limit means, and it is the intended
  behaviour for a deployment whose every principal is the same person.

If this ever stops being a single-owner deployment, the limit to revisit is
that second one — and the answer then is accounts and quotas, not a shared
bucket.
