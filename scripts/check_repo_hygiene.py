    Asking per file spawned one ``git cat-file`` per tracked path: measured at
    5.35 seconds and about 170 processes on this repository, against roughly
    0.03 seconds before, growing linearly with the index. That is a bad trade
    for a gate that runs on every commit and in CI.

    ``--batch -Z`` answers the whole list down one pipe with NUL framing on
    both sides. Git paths may contain newlines, so newline-delimited requests
    would split one path into several queries and desynchronise the stream.
    Every resolved object — blob or not — has its declared body and trailing
    delimiter consumed; skipping the body of a non-blob (a gitlink resolving to
    a commit that exists in the object store) would leave those bytes in the
    pipe and make every later path read the wrong frame.

    A missing response is ``<requested-name> missing`` with no body. The name
    may itself contain spaces, so detection is by the trailing `` missing``
    marker rather than by splitting and inspecting a fixed field index.

    Only the SQLite header is retained from a blob. The remainder is discarded
    in bounded chunks so a large blob never lands in memory whole.

    If ``cat-file`` itself fails (for example because this Git build does not
    support ``-Z``), the gate fails closed rather than reporting a clean tree.
