"""Run every offline gate this repository has, in one command.

The checks existed before this script did; what did not exist was one way to
run them. CI listed them as five separate workflow steps, the README listed
four of them, and `docs/validation.md` listed eleven POSIX-flavoured command
lines. Three lists drift: a gate added to CI is invisible to a contributor
reading the README, and a contributor who runs the README's list can be green
locally and red on the pull request. So the list lives HERE, once, and both CI
and the documentation point at this file instead of repeating it.

Standard library only, deliberately: this is the script someone runs BEFORE
they have worked out which extras to install, and it must be able to tell them
that the linter or the test runner is missing rather than fail on its own
imports. Server steps are spawned with ``sys.executable``, so the interpreter
that runs this script is the interpreter they run under - on Windows as well as
on Linux, where the documented `.venv/bin/python` prefix does not exist. The
opt-in client suite is the one exception and says so: it runs under
``client/.venv``, because no single environment can hold both sides.

The working directory does not matter; the repository root is derived from this
file's location and every step is run there.

    python scripts/validate.py            # everything, in order
    python scripts/validate.py --list     # what it would run, runs nothing
    python scripts/validate.py --quick    # everything except the test suite
    python scripts/validate.py --only ruff
    python scripts/validate.py --client   # additionally: the desktop client suite

Exit status is 0 only when every selected step passed. The first failing step
stops the run and its name is printed, so the output says which gate failed
rather than leaving the reader to match a traceback to a command.
