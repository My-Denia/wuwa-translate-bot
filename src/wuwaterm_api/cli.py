There is deliberately no self-service registration route: devices are
registered by an operator with shell access on the host, over SSH.

``device issue`` reads the secret from standard input and never prints it.
Nothing in this service emits a credential, so no credential can reach a log,
a terminal recording or a captured command output through it. The operator
generates the secret where it will be stored, pastes or pipes it in, and keeps
it in the OS credential manager on the client machine. The command prints the
device id, which is not a secret, and the token is simply
``wtd1.<device_id>.<that secret>``.
