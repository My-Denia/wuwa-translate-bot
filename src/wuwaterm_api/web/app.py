"""The owner-private web presentation layer, mounted inside the API process.

WHY IN THIS PROCESS (the full argument lives in docs/adr/0014): ADR 0009
accounts the LLM budget per process. A third process would carry a third
independent budget, so the aggregate ceiling across the deployment would rise
even though no single limit changed - which is the opposite of "add no new
amplification surface". Sharing the process also removes the need for a
front-end backend that holds a device token and forwards it: the browser
session is resolved to an already-authenticated principal inside the same
process, so ADR 0010's device-principal semantics are untouched.

WHAT SHARING COSTS, stated plainly because a reader deserves it: a defect here
can take down the process the desktop client depends on. Three mitigations - a
sub-application mount rather than routes merged into the API's own router, a
startup switch that is OFF by default, and a private protection layer that
sits in front at the edge rather than inside this code.

HOW THE SHARED INSTANCES ARE SHARED, which is the subtle part: this
sub-application does not receive copies of the rate limiter and the call
budget. It is given the parent's ``State`` OBJECT ITSELF. Copying references at
construction time would have looked equivalent and been wrong, because the
credential pool is REPLACED on every lifespan cycle - a copy taken at
construction would point at a dead executor after the first restart of the ASGI
lifespan. Sharing the object means there is nothing to keep in step, and it
makes the property testable by identity rather than by inspection.
