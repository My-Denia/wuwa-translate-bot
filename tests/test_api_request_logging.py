"""Server-side request records for the HTTP adapter.

Two separate properties are under test here and they fail in different ways:

* the service EMITS a record at all. Until this module existed the adapter
  called ``LOGGER.info`` in a dozen places and configured no handler anywhere,
  so a deployed process produced no per-request evidence — a request id handed
  to a client could not be matched to anything on the server.
* what the record CONTAINS. A log line is an output channel like any other, so
  the same rules that govern the response body govern it. The rule is about what
  the SERVICE knows: no credential, no device id behind an authenticated
  principal, no request text. A caller's own bytes are a different question —
  they may appear, bounded and escaped, because a record of them tells a reader
  only what the writer of the request already had; what they may never do is
  reach an operator's terminal unescaped, forge a field, or be a credential.

The privacy half is asserted against captured records rather than by reading
the source, because the interesting failures (a field added later, a framework
that starts logging on its own) are invisible to inspection.
