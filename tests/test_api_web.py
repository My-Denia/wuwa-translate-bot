"""The owner-private web presentation layer.

Everything here runs in-process against the ASGI app, in the same style as
tests/test_api.py. The properties under test are the ones that make this
surface safe to expose at all:

- with the switch off it does not exist, so nothing about the API changes;
- a request that did not come through the edge is refused before it reaches
  application logic;
- no credential material ever reaches the browser;
- it spends the SAME rate limiter and the SAME call budget as the API, rather
  than a second set that would raise the deployment's aggregate ceiling;
- it enforces the same scopes the API enforces over the same pipeline.
